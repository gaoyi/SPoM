### Summary ###
Following the paper:

Gao Y, Bouix S. Statistical Shape Analysis using 3D Poisson
Equation---A Quantitatively Validated Approach. Medical Image
Analysis. 2016 Jan 15.

this repository contains code to perform statistical analysis on 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology. It contains an iterative 3D Poisson
equation solver using ITK (VNL) sparse system.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Statistical shape analysis

### How do I get set up? ###

* CMake (cmake.org)
* ITK (itk.org, Compilation needed)
* alglib library
* GNU gsl

### Docker

The built version is also available on Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/gaoyi/spom/

```bash
docker pull gaoyi/spom
```


### Who do I talk to? ###

* Yi Gao (gaoyi@gatech.edu)

### Usage agreement ###

In scientific publications (journal publications, conference papers,
technical reports, presentations at conferences and meetings) that use
this code, you should cite the following paper:
